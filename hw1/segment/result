.. ( 0) HEADL	HEADL			            IBM Corporation
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The problem of model-based object recognition is a fundamental one in the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	field of computer vision, and we believe that it represents a promising
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	direction for practical applications.  Realistic object recognition systems
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	need to be able to perform well with noisy inputs, and within reasonable time
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	bounds.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	In the first part of the talk,  we present an analytical study of the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	performance of the geometric hashing method in the presence of noise.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Geometric hashing is a representative of  a class of algorithms that
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	facilitate object recognition in a computationally advantageous way.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	In the second part, we describe an interpretation of geometric hashing that
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	allows the algorithm to be viewed as a Bayesian approach to model-based object
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	recognition.  This interpretation, which is a new form of Bayesian-based model
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	matching, leads to well-justified formulas, and gives a precise weighted-voting
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	method for the evidence-gathering phase of geometric hashing. These formulas
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	replace traditional heuristically-derived methods for performing weighted
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	voting, and also provide a precise method for evaluating uncertainty.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Using the Concert/C language, we have implemented a prototype  distributed
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	object recognition system that employs our Bayesian matching ideas. The
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	computational platform is a small group of public workstations.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The resulting system is scalable and can recognize aircraft and automobile
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	models subjected to 2D rotation, translation, and scale changes in real-world
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	digital imagery. This is the first system of its kind that is scalable, uses
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	large databases, can handle noisy input data, works rapidly using readily
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	available computational resources, and exhibits excellent performance
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	with real-world, natural scenes.

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	   In his presentation at Northwestern on Shuttle by United, Sky Magary
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	outlined the reasons for the creation of Shuttle and fit with the rest of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the airline. A summary of his points follows.
.. ( 0) HEADL	HEADL	WHY SHUTTLE HAD TO BE TRIED
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM	1) California was Strategicaly Important to UA
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Historically, 50% of UA's Origin/Destination/Connecting traffic was in the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	western US.  UA's western strength was strategically important in
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	competing with American Airlines which was traditionally strong in the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	East.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	In 1991 UA had 50% of the local market share in California.  In that same
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	year, WN entered all of UA's traditional markets except SFO.  By 1994 UA
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	had abandonned every route which did not attach to a long haul route.  Its
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	cost per ASM was US$.11 versus $.075 for WN.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	UA faced the prospect of losing high-margin long haul markets to AA if it
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	could not shore up the West coast feeds.
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM	2) California has good densities.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	By UA's estimate, only 1/4 of US markets are suited to point-to-point
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	service (more on the implications of this for WN in another post)  Of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	these dense markets, only the ones in the West allowed free entry.  The
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	dense eastern markets had slot-controlled airports at least one endpoint.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	To UA this implies both that California was the right place to offer
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	point-to-point and that unless slot restrictions are removed, the East
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	will never be a suitable Shuttle market.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	What is a good, dense market?  By UA's estimate, there are 12
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	point-to-point markets in Califoria which have more than 1000 PDEW
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	(passengers per day, each way)
XX ( 0) PTEXT	HEADL	TO MAKE SURE THAT SHUTTLE WOULD WORK...
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	UA really agonized over all the operational details of it shuttle [my
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	note: unlike CO which simply copied WN]
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	1) UA chose gates close to the runway, not close to the landside, to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	minimize taxi time
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	2) UA changed pilot checkoff procedures, recognizing that a plane that was
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	on the ground many times a day would have a different maintenance feedback
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	loop than a plane flown cross country.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	3) UA implemented their WILMA boarding procedure (Window, Middle, Aisle).
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	This had the interesting side effect of balancing demand between window
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	and aisle seats. SInce they board first, window pax get to hog the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	overhead bins, while aisle customers get the traditional easy-in-easy-out
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	advantage. In operation WILMA allows a 126 passenger 737 to be boarded in
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	10-13 minutes and in experiments they've been able to board a 195 seat 175
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	in 15 minutes.  (They have no plans to add 757 to shuttle at this time
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	4) Keep the travel agents happy. in OAK-LAX (the second biggest O&D market
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	for WN) UA offers 1/3 of the seats, but gets 50-55% of agency bookings.
.. ( 0) HEADL	HEADL	WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	5) About 1/3 of UA's premier customers don't like the new shuttle, either
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	because they had a set commuting pattern or because they don't see the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	benefit of lower prices (their business paid). On the other hand 2/3
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	prefer the lower fares and better frequency of the Shuttle. Magary says
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	that UA should have done a special mailing to its premiers (rather than an
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	insert in the FF mailings) which wouldh have explained all of Shuttle's
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	changes (like how the longer walk to gates close to the runway would save
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	taxi time)
.. ( 0) HEADL	HEADL	RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	6) They may experiment with a simpler [and I bet much cheaper] paint
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	scheme on a few new 737's  it retained the blue striped tail and blue
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	belly, but had a light fuselage [probably to cut air conditioning and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	painting costs] and script Shuttle logo
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	7) UA is satisfied with the ability of Shuttle to feed pax to the rest of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the UA system--either through frequent flier loyalty or direct
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	connection.  Shuttle handles $360M worth of pax shared with the rest of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	UA's system [the kind of figure that the folks in Finance love, but no one
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	knows what it means]
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	8) Shuttle's cost per ASM is now below .08 and they've told the analysts
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	they expect it to be down to .076 by the end of the year.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	9) UA is consciously collecting the "historical premium" from last-minute
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	travellers which travel from SFO commands. Since folks have been
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	conditioned to pay more out of SFO, UA sees no reason to cut prices to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	compete with SJC or OAK.  At the same time, UA is keeping OAK and SFO
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	prices more competitive for advance purchases.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	10)The California competitors are currently matching prices and flooding
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the market with capacity.  As some of that capacity is wrung out by
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	competition (as UA's was from OAK-ONT), expect to see it redeployed in
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	markets like SFO-PDX and xxx-PHX or LAS.  However, due to the needs of the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Denver hub (and its profits from traditional service) don't expect to see
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	much expansion of Shuttle outside of West Coast markets.

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	   Sky Magary, President of Shuttle by United, in his speech at NU alluded
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	to the limits on point-to-point service.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	   He asserted that only about 1/4 of US markets can support direct
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	service and most of these are on the West Coast.  Since this implied that
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	WN was serving many non-point-to-point markets with point-to-point
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	service, I asked him to explain the discrepancy.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	   He believes that at PHX, STL, MCI, and DTW, Souhtwest is dependant on
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	connecting (or multi-stop) passengers--that is to say most of the people
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	who are on a plane in these cites are either just passing through or will
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	be on the flight for more than just the first leg out of the city. The
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	hubbed airlines have realized this and have begun to match WN's one-stop
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	service with good connections at comparable prices via their hubs.  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	   This is one of the unseen sources of pressure on WN's bottom line: all
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	that service WN added in the midwest and east relies on one-stop and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	multi-stop passengers to fill the planes.  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	   We tend only to see how WN competes in its traditional non-stop markets
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	(CA and TX).  We tend to focuson WN's high frequencies and low prices on
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	non-stops because they are few and easy to track and WN tells us they are
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	a point-to-point airline.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	    But the real fight with WN in the east and midwest is in all those
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	connecting markets where only those with advanced computer systems can
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	really see how connections can systematically beat one-stops and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	multi-stops. Perhaps this is why Northwest went to three daily

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	scheduled stop in ANC.  TPE-JFK is nonstop if the tail winds are good. 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	(or do I have that reversed???)
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Speaking of TPE-JFK, it has been rumored that CAL will switch to

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Going back to refueling stops, whether a plane can fly to a particular place 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	on a given day depends on  the payload and the weather.  If the weather 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	is good (tail winds) then  the allowable payload is higher.  If the

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	a certain figure called the  maximum takeoff weight, which depends on the

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I don't think any of these airlines are goverment subsidized.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I think it's the lack of competition in their home countries, except for 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	CAL (which still made a marginal profit last year, despite the crash at NGO

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Today's Wall St. Journal has an article on page A2 about United's
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	scaled back fleet expansion plans.  Gerald Greenwald, chairman and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	CEO of United, told analysts that the airline now plans a net
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	addition of 19 aircraft between now and the end of 1997 instead of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	a net addition of 48 aircraft under an earlier plan.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The article goes on to note that United's fleet has a relatively
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	low average age of 10 years, but about 8% of their planes are 25
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	years old or older.  It also breaks down the 94 aircraft expected
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	to be retired by the end of 1999:
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM	  - 18 747s -- Presumably the entire 747-100 fleet, which includes
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		13 ancient 747-122s that United bought new and another three
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		even more elderly, ex-American 747-123s.  The article claims
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		these aircraft won't meet noise standards, yet the seven ex-
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		Qantas 747-238Bs aren't much better.
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM	  - 31 DC-10s -- I'm afraid I've lost track of how many DC-10s United
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		has retired thus far.  This undoubtedly covers the entire
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		DC-10-10 fleet, but I'm not sure if it includes the eight-
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		member DC-10-30 fleet or not.  The latter aircraft are based
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		in Honolulu, I believe, and except for HNL-ORD non-stops and
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		occasional trips to SFO for maintenance they mainly fly to
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		and within Southeast Asia.
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM	  - 45 737-200s -- All of the remaining 737-222s, but not the 24-
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		member fleet of 737-200 Advanced aircraft acquired from the
XX ( 0) PTEXT	ITEM		original Frontier in the late 1980s.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The most interesting part of the article was reading between the lines.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The above retirement list totals 94 aircraft, which means even if no new
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	planes arrive between the end of 1997 and 2000, United expects to take
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	delivery of 113 new aircraft.  However, their current firm orders total
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	only 58 aircraft -- 24 A320 deliveries are still outstanding from the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	firm order for 50, and 34 777s are on firm order.  What might the other
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	55 aircraft be?
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The WSJ article only hints at what else might in the works, saying that
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	a Boeing spokesman had confirmed talkes about new orders between Boeing
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	and United.  It doesn't mention the 50 A320 options nor the 34 777
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	options.  I think there are also additional 747-400 orders and options
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	still on the books, though that got shuffled around a lot several years
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	ago when United wanted to cancel some 777 orders.  (I've also heard
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	that United has expressed interest in picking up several more 747-400s
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	if they become available with quick deliveries and good prices, like
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the two that Northwest cancelled in 1993 and United picked up last
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	year.)
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	A more interesting proposition might be an order for more 737s.  United
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	has already said that they expect Shuttle by United to make money this
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	year, and despite retrenchments in a few markets they're growing quite
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	rapidly.  They "only" have a pool of 101 737-300s and around 60 -500s
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	that must not only support Shuttle flights but, along with the -200s,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	all of United's shorter flights.  Don't forget the pending retirement
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	of the 45 737-222s, so while demand is increasing, supply is going down
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	to the tune of almost 20% of their 230 aircraft 737 fleet.  If Shuttle
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	continues to grow, United *must* buy additional small aircraft, and the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	737 in some flavor is the obvious choice.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	At the other end of the spectrum, the 747-100s supplement the -400s in
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the Pacific markets (as the "small" aircraft!) and the 767 fleet on the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	heavy routes across the Atlantic (from the east coast -- they don't
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	have the range to fly California-Europe) and also down to South

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Well, for starters, the only current Chapter 11 carrier is Mark Air,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	which isn't all that big a carrier. A bunch of carriers have used
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	chapter 11 to restructure. Arguing that the industry would be happier
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	without those carriers in business is hard to do, as what ifs are always
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	somewhat a matter of opinion. But, I'd point out that the history of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	what happens to domestic carriers as they go belly up is that low
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	cost carriers spring up in thier markets and the remaning majors
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	move in on the markets from thier own strongholds. Both of these
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	activities can lead to farewars. 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Fare wars have been waged by both the previous chapter 11 carriers
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	when they were (and were not) under chapter 11 protection and the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	non chapter 11 carriers. The economics of the airline industry are
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	very nasty. The major carriers found out just how nasty when
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	deregulation struck. While some did better than others, all hit
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	pretty rough going. 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	As long as you have a large number of seats chasing after a smaller
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	number of customers, and it's better to make some money then no money
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	from a customer, the airlines will have an incentive to offer fares
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	right down to the incremental cost to carry the additional body. 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The industry, as a whole has been slowly shedding capacity, as the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	various players deal with some of the realities of the marketplace. This,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	coupled with growth in travel, has given the industry as a whole some
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	relief. (As has a mjor focus on productivity, better route management,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	more efficient scheduling, etc) 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	All of the efforts to cut capacity and be more efficient won't help
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	much as long as people can enter cheaply and run at very low margins.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	There's no reason to imagine that this won't happen. As you point out,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	there are plenty of airplanes to be had cheap. One can imagine the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	ongoing scenario of people opening up little low cost carriers, running
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	thier planes into the ground as they make just enough profit to keep
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	in business, but not enough to cover the cost of new planes. At the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	same time, they lower the profitability of all thier compeitors as well,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	keeping it hard for them to replace planes. 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Since there's no bar to entry (Unless your last name is Lorenzo) 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	anyone can do this in any market, and they only have to convince
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	thier backers they might make enough money to pay off their loans. 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Of course, as far as I can tell, every business plan ever offered
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	to the banks is optimistic (Probably a requirement to start a
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	business in the first place) The industry is littered with
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	optimists who didn't realize how hard it is to make money and how
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	easy it is to lose money. 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I don't think that you can blame Chapter 11 for all the industry's
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	ills. Stupidity, greed, pride, and people who spent 40 years in a
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	cozy, regulated industry trying to deal with a free market with
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	totally new dynamics all have a place when it comes to blame.

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	JFK is without a doubt the most insanely crappy airport in the United

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	there I am simply amazed at the complete shoddiness of the entire
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	operation, and the totally bungled "JFK 2000" project (now on hold
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	until 3000) has only added to the frustration and confusion of the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	place.  Even some things which could be remedied without any hassle
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	whatsoever are left unattended -- for example, in the UA terminal,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	why does the bar not take credit cards?  And I do not mean -- it 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	does not take my favorite credit card, it just doesn't take them
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	period.  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	So now to the question:  why do people prefer it?  I wondered about this
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	repeatedly during the ten years that I lived in the New York area, and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	finally came up with four reasons:
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	* prestige from the past.  Crazy as it may seem, to many middle- and late-
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	middle-aged New Yorkers, international travel still means departing from
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	"Idlewild".  There is a nostalgic romance in their minds which the present
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	condition of the airport apparently does not shatter.  Add to this what
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	for many New Yorkers remains the "stigma" of New Jersey and these folks
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	will continue to choose JFK for international departures.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	* force of habit.  Believe it or not, it took many New Yorkers years to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	realize that a build-up of international service had taken place at
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	EWR.  As a friend from northern New Jersey once commented, "Newark was
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	our little secret for years and years".  Once word began to get out,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	many people took a long time to change their patterns.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	* orneriness.  Complaining about JFK is a full-time occupation for many
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	well-traveled New Yorkers.  EWR is simply too easy to use for the cranky
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	New York soul.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	* and finally a more "objective" reason.  A lot of the pax at JFK are not
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	coming from Manhattan (and therefore relatively equidistant from EWR and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	JFK) but rather from Long Island.  JFK is their closest international
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	gateway (Islip has increasing domestic service but that's all).  Getting
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	from Long Island to New Jersey is a colossal hassle and for anyone living
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	in Nassau and certainly Suffolk counties, is not really a viable option.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	There's a couple million people right there "captive" to JFK.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	To think that Angelenos complain about LAX...

.. ( 0) NNHEAD	NNHEAD	NNTP-Posting-Host: rocza.kei.com
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Newsweek has just published a special report on air travel safety in the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	United States, in the wake of a year in which more there more fatalities than 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	in the previous four years combined.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	In the article, Newsweek detailed what it thinks are the major problems that
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	threaten safe air travel in the U.S.  Allow me to summarize:
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(1) Antiquated air traffic control system
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			Some aspects of our system date to prewar times, such as 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			pilots flying over the Atlantic using high frequency radios 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			to speak to controllers in Islip to report flight progress 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			through a third party, thus slowing response time considerably,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			becasue the FAA lacks equipment that can follow a plane acros
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			the Atlantic.
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(2) Wind Shear
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			A problem that can be treated by the installation of Doppler 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			Radar Systems (TDWR), but has been hindered by environmental as
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			well as political oppostion.  Doppler Technology is only in 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			place at IAH, MEM, and STL.  The FAA says that 47 additional 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			Dopplers will be working by 1996.  
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(3) Ice Buildup/Problems with De-Icing
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			Ground delays causing ice buildup even after the aircraft has
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			been de-iced because the chemical only protects the wings for
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			fifteen minutes.  Problems with commuter aircraft is discussed
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			as well.
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(4) Terrorism
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			Yesterday's bombing in Oklahoma City is just another example of
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			how vunerable the United States is to terrorist attacks.  The
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			article maintains that it is very easy for a terrorist to bomb 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			a domestic flight, but suggests that they may not realize how 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			easy it is.  Technology to fight this would cost ridiculous 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			amounts of money.
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(5) Conflicts Between "Man and Machine"
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			A certain aircraft manufacturer whose name starts with an "A"
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			was mentioned several times in this section, with a United 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			pilot being quoted as saying "Why did it do that" in refrence
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			to an action performed by his aircraft.
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(6) Ground Collisions/Traffic
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			This topic ties into the first one, the fact that controllers
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			lack equipment that can warn them of possible ground 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			collisions.  The window is the only way a controller can see
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			aircraft on the ground now, and radar systems are being 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			pointed to as a method of warning controllers of impending
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			accidents.  This technology is also very expensive, and has 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM			some oppostion within the FAA. 			 			    
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The article goes on to elaborate on each of these issues, supported by
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	citations of disasters and the input of industry insiders.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The section concludes with a list of ten ways in which the air travel industry
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	can be made safer.  Those are:
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(1) immediate modernization of the Air Traffic Control System, 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(2) taking control of the FAA away from Congress,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(3) make the FAA enforce safety issues only, not economic ones,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(4) improve flight data recording devices,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(5) set higher standards for pilots,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(6) increase the number of controllers,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(7) eliminate "lap rides" for children under two and require 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		    safety seats for children,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(8) improve airport security,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(9) get Doppler technology up and running where it is most needed
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		    immediately, and
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		(10) listen to what fliers want.  According to a Newsweek poll, 71% 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		    of fliers would pay higher fares for safety improvements, and 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		    94% of those surveyed said they would tolerate delays and 
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM		    cancellations in favor of higher safety standards.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Another part of the article that caught my eye was Newsweek's own statistical 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	ratings of the airlines, as far as safety is concerned.  Based on data from 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the last ten years, the rankings are as follows, with death risk:
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    American		0
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    Southwest		0
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    TWA			0
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE	     	    Continental		1 in 10 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    Delta		1 in 8 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    United		1 in 4 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    Northwest		1 in 3 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    USAir		1 in 2 million
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I compared these figures to the study presented in Newsweek's issue dated 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	September 19, 1994, based on a twenty year test period.
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    Southwest		0
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    Continental		1 in 15 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    Delta		1 in 10 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    American		1 in 10 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE	            United		1 in 8 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    TWA			1 in 5 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    Northwest		1 in 4 million
XX ( 0) HEADL	TABLE		    USAir		1 in 2.5 million
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Numbers were also presented for a limited number of international carriers, 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	with Air Canada, Quantas, El Al, British Airways, and Japan Air Lines being 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the safest.  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I found the article to be quite interesting, but would have like to have seen 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the charts contain more information (i.e., more carriers).  I also found the 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	descriptions of wind shear and icing to be particularly good, supported by 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	excellent graphics.  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	One problem that I had was seeing NW's low rating on both lists.  I can't 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	remember a NW accident in the last five years.  In fact, the only one I 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	remember is the DC-10 that crashed near DTW several years ago.  I have to be 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	missing some, especially if their rating is so close to that of USAir's, for
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	whom I can name at least six accidents off the top of my head.  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	All in all, I recommend the article to everyone who reads this newsgroup and 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	anyone else who flies, not to intimidate them, but rather to inform them as 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	to the state of air travel safety in the United States.  While the article may
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	not be totally objective or scientific, it will give you something to think
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	about.  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I'm sorry about the length of this post.  I hope that it was found to be 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	informative.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Happy, and above all, safe, flying to all.

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The -123s have the old three-window upper deck with a 19' upper cabin

.. ( 0) QUOTED	QUOTED	>- Do the 222s and 238Bs fly the same routes? (all seem out of SFO or NRT)
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The -222Bs and -238Bs are very different aircraft.  The -222Bs are
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	amongst the last 1st generation 747s built, and at 833,000 lbs MGTOW,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	they're actually capable of higher weights than an Air France -400!
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	They are configured with a very premium mix of seats (35/134/124) and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	generally stay on the JFK-NRT routes they were purchased for or switch
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	over the EWR-NRT depending on loads.  The only other route I've ever
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	seen one fly is EWR-SFO, presumably for maintenance.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The seven ex-Qantas -238Bs are, in contrast, fairly early examples, 12
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	years older than the two -222Bs, and even after several upgrade rounds

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	interchangeable because the -238Bs have a different seating config,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	due to their main galley being on the main deck instead of below as on

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	hub operation in the mid 80's. The hope was that by going to the new

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I can only assume that people are more willing to fly on an airline using

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the stairs to a 747 with all of your carryons?. Not a pretty site in

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I don't have specifics on the construction cost, but most of the physical 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	plant construction was financed by the Port from what I remember: PE was 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	only locked into the long term lease and not really liable for more than 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the jetways, bagbelt systems and other interior furnishings for space 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	occupied by PE. In general, the Port provides the basics i.e. lighting,  
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	walls, floor coverings in the public areas and concourse halls, 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	heating and air conditioning. The carrier provides the rest i.e. gate 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	holdroom carpeting, ticket counters, etc....
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	In this regard, the costs are the same at DIA as they were for PE/CO at 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	EWR. The major difference is that for PE, there was no increase in landing 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	fees or general cost of doing business increases. They retained the same 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	maintenance and catering facilities, as well as the proximity to their 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	training facilities and general offices. They were able to maintain the 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	same contracts for hotels, fuel, etc... This is not the case at DIA, 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	where the investment in a maintenance facility for most carriers was 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	written off. The proximity and convenience that UA had for their crew 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	training facility and their data center is now lost. Many of the 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	negotiated hotel contracts for crews had to be cancelled in favor of 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	hotels closer to DIA (which are few at the moment...). Fuel, catering and 
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	other service contract costs will be higher as the contractors now have to

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The definition of what is and isn't a hub gets blurry around the margins.  I
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	chose to exclude airports like Boston, La Guardia and LAX because I see them
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	as much more of a concentration of flights than a real hub.  The so-called

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Again the National Institute for Aviation Research has churned out their
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	annual ranking of Airline Quality.  And unless they've made some serious
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	changes in their methods (and from what I've heard so far they have not),
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	their results are pretty much meaningless.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I've complained about this ranking before, but recently I came upon the July
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	1994 issue of "Consumer Reports Travel Letter" which points out the many
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	flaws of this much-hyped "ranking" quite well.  I'll draw from their
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	words as well as my own thoughts for this posting.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Three semi-reasonable factors used in the Airline Quality Ratings:
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	*Lost Baggage:  Makes sense to me
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	*Bumping:  They only consider *involuntary* bumping, not total denied
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	boardings due to overbooking.  One of the biggest total-bumpers (AA) is also
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	one of the best at coaxing people to volunteer, and thus ranks very well.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	*On-time performance:  This statistic is so manipulated that it is only
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	marginally related to what "on-time" is commonly perceived as.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The AQR includes complaints per 10,000 passengers in their survey, but
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	counts this as not one but *eight* separate factors ("flight problems",
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	"fares", "customer service", "refunds", "advertising", "credit", "refunds"
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	and "other").  By counting this one factor as eight, it makes up almost half
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	of the entire set of scoring elements.  Complaints are important, but this
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	is much overstated.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The AQR has three factors which are surrogates for "safety".  But there is
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	absolutely positively no reasonably valid way to include the factor of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	safety among the major airlines.  Despite what the fools at Newsweek (who
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	have demonstrated a clear knowledge of 8th grade algebra with their
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	statistical evaluations) there is no significant difference between the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	major airlines in terms of safety.  This has no business in a quality survey
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	of any credibility.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The AQR includes three factors that have zippo corelation with "quality":
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	*Financial Stability, and
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	*Cost per Seat Mile:  I suppose they wanted some way of proving that
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	financially-troubled airlines are "bad".  But ask youself...has AA's Quality
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	imporved versus 1992 when they were losing money hand over fist?  Is DL's
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	quality *improving* as they continue to cut ASM costs?  Duh.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	*Fleet Size:  This is laughable.  Nothing makes an airline with a bigger

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	airport to view the planes at the gates.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	    Second, even though flying is safer than driving to the local Food Lion,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	crashes do occur. USAir has enough of a PR problem when its logo is

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	4000 seats a week aren't that many.  However, there is no reciprocating

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Airlines like Malaysia, Thai, and even Singapore have been offer

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Well, I have to argue with you on this one.  Cathay has been very conscious
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	about its cost.  It has moved some of its operations from Hong Kong to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	reduce costs.  The management was very aggressive in making the cockpit

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Well, the L1011 utilization is not a very good example for at least two
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	reasons:
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	1. CX's L1011s are used just like the B737/MD80 are used by US carriers.
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   Most of the sectors served by CX's L1011s are between 1.5 hours to 3.5
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   hours.  Furthermore, many East Asian airports have night curfews.
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   Therefore, 6-9 hours of utilization are not unreasonable.  CX is
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   definitely not alone in this category.  If you check out TG's, MH's,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   CI's A300 and SQ's A310 utilizations, you'll find CX's L1011 number is
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   not low.  Actually, CX has been very good in keeping high utilization
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   of its long-haul aircraft.  When CX got its first few B747s in 1979/80,
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   I was shocked that the average B747 utilization for CX was around 16
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   hours a day!
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	2. CX's L1011s are fully depreciated, thus, they can afford to collect
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   some dust (remember there are many more L1011s in the deserts that are
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   not generating a single cent of revenue).  I believe CX also operate a
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   lot of extra and "chartered" flights.  For example, supplement flights

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I think you're a little bit harsh on HK.  HK has one of the freest markets
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	in the world.  Do not extrapolate HK's conservative aviation policies to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	general trading policies.  The Hong Kong Aviation Authority may be
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	anti-competition, but the Australian government has been practicing

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	anti-competition aviation policies that I can remember:

.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   incidence that I can remember a government made a _major_ effort to
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	   impose limit on six-freedom rights.)
.. ( 0) ITEM	ITEM	2. in 1993, NW's OSA-SYD fiasco,

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	reliability/ maintenance costs.  At the same time, a new 100-120 seat
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	airplane (read: 737, MD-80, or 320 series) costed around $30,000,000
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	(last time I checked - around 1991) and the cost of hush-kitting an
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	older airplane like a 727 or DC-9 costs around $3,000,000 (again,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	these figures were approximate in 1991).  Thus, the increased fuel
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	efficiency and reduced reliability/maintenance costs are *dwarfed* by
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the ~$25,000,000 savings of using hush kits over new aircraft.  When I
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	worked at Northwest, there was a study floating around that made the

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I wish I had a copy of this.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	As the original poster noted, this savings is especially true for the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	DC-9s which tend to age better than the B-727 or B-737.  This explains

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	emergency course for Bermuda and flew too low to communicate with the

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	had been forced to ditch in the water, they would not have had a precise
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	location to send rescuers.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	A private subcontractor, Aeronautical Radio Inc., was used to relay radio
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	messages between the airliner and the ATC. The company transcribes
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	reports and then transmits them by teletype to the Controllers at he
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	FAA's New York Center. The controllers keep track of locations in their
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	heads, or use grease pencils on Plexiglas!!!!
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The incident itself was as follows: the pilot was flying at 33000 ft
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	about 330 miles south of Bermuda when he radioed that he had a possible
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	oil filter blockage in one engine and asked for permission to descend to

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	telephoned Aeronautical Radio, and asked to be patched through to the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	plane. -- that took 5 minutes and was considered to be pretty quick!
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The pilot later reported that the engine had shut down. The pilot had to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	descend to unusually low altitudes because of a loss in cabin pressure.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	The shut-down of one engine meant the loss of an air conditioning unit,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	and the remaining unit overheated.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Newsweek had an article just last week on the antiquated ATC equipment!

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	SIA is looking for a regional jet, hence, the MD-11 is definitely out of
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the question.  Furthermore, SIA does not have a good track record with MD,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	or, perhaps I should say MD does not have a good track record with SIA.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	SIA dumped the DC-10 after ~ 5 years of operation.  SIA did not even take
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the delivery of the last two (of seven) aircraft and sold them directly to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Varig.  Around 1990, SIA signed an MOU with MD to order up to 20 MD-11s.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	At the time, one of the major reasons for the order was because both Delta
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	and Swissair (SIA's cross-equity partners) had ordered the MD-11s.  Later,
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	MD and P&W failed to guarantee certain performance, and SIA switched to
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	the A340.  Currently, SIA has 17 A340s on order (plus 20 options) for
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	long-haul services.  Thus, on paper, the A330 is the more likely
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	candidate, and Airbus made a news release a few weeks ago claiming that

.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	As I said it before, the edge apparently goes to Airbus, but I believe
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	Boeing has a good chance.
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	I don't know whether the Japanese contents in the B777 will affect SIA's
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	decision, but I believe Singapore Aerospace is a subcontractor of the B777
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	program, too.  IMHO, the B777 is better sized for the Asian market.  If I
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	were an SIA executive, I would have picked the B777.  The B777-200 may be
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	a little too big to replace some of SIA's A310s (so is the A330, and SIA
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	is reported to be looking for a smaller aircraft later on).  However, the
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	B777-300 is the most ideal aircraft to replace the B747s used for regional
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	services.  SIA's order is important to the A330 program, but I would not
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	go so far to say it's a make-or-break order for the A330.  The A330
.. ( 0) PTEXT	PTEXT	program still has some other potential customers.  (See my up-coming
